  When former NIMH chief Dr. Thomas Insel speaks, people listen. Dr. Insel
  famously criticized the DSM a couple of years ago for its lack of reliability.
  He notably broke ranks with the APA by saying there were no bio-markers, blood
  tests, genetic tests or imaging tests that could verify or establish a DSM
  diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar or schizoaffective disorder.
