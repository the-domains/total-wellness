  Imagine if every element of the total possible existence of everything could
  respond to the question: what is your purpose? The honest answer from all but
  humans would be: "I don't know what I'm doing right now. I'm just doing it.
  That's why it's being done."

Imagine if every element of the total possible existence of everything could respond to the question: what is your purpose? The honest answer from all but humans would be: "I don't know what I'm doing right now. I'm just doing it. That's why it's being done."

This might be the response of any of the untold billions of elements involved in interactions that occur precisely programmed to produce stable and unstable everything from an apparent nothing. It seems no-thing is filled with the potential for everything and everything is programmed to produce specific things and random things according to sometimes discernible and definable rules we can understand and apply.

Driven by internal and external mechanisms from the micro to the macro, each element performs according to it's nature. Interactions are controlled or not by the system in which they occur. Co-incidences may demonstrate cycles and programmed repeatability when studied closely enough, like comets and meteor showers.

Certainly, each element is playing a part in the greater whole which goes on with or without it. The same is true at every level of our being and becoming. We are not conscious of the birth or passing of any natural process unless it is disturbed.
