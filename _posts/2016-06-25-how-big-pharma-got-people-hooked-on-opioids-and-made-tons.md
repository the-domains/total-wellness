      As complaints grow about exorbitant drug prices, pharmaceutical companies
      are coming under pressure to disclose the development costs and profits of
      those medicines and the rationale for charging what they do. So-called
      pharmaceutical cost transparency bills have been introduced in at least
      six state legislatures in the last year, aiming to make drug companies
      justify their prices, which are often attributed to high research and
      development costs.

  How did America get to a point where legal opioid painkillers, marketed as
  medicine, killed nearly 19,000 people in 2014? One alarming explanation is
  that the drug companies behind these opioids wanted more people to buy their
  product, so they led a misleading campaign to get doctors to prescribe their
  drugs.
